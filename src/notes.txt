* morkParser.cpp is a good reference.
* Might want a custom warning class for unimplemented mork features.
* Missing a lot of exception handling.
* Maybe add meta-table suppression option.
* Maybe add row ID as a hidden column, optionally displayed.

Good things to add before public release:
* README
* Optimizations
* Correct XML
* Better help text (with defaults)
