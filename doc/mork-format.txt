Mork 1.4 File Format Description

1. Logical Structure

Mork files logically consist of zero or more Tables. Each table consists
of zero or more rows and optional metadata in the form of a Meta-Table.
Each row consists of zero or more Cells and optional metadata in the
form of a Meta-Row. Each cell is a Column-Value pair.

This makes Mork Tables structurally similar to a spreadsheet or an HTML
table, with rows and columns, and entries appearing in the cells formed
by the intersection of a row and column. One important difference is
that the Columns are not necessarily the same from one row to the next.
A Mork Row may include arbitrary Columns.

While the basic structure of the data is fairly simple, the Mork format
itself is confusing, all but impossible to decode by hand, and poorly
documented. The documentation that exists seems to contradict the
Mozilla implementation of Mork 1.4, probably the only widely-used
version (according to source comments in morkWriter.h[2] and release
dates, earlier versions were used only for very early milestone releases
of the Mozilla Suite).

2. File Layout

2.1 Encoding

Mork files are text, and appear to be limited to ASCII characters.
However, all example files I've looked at include this:

// (f=iso-8859-1)

This identifies a character encoding, but doesn't seem to have any
functional significance. The double-slashes indicate that it is a
comment, so the parser ignores it. The text of the comment is hard-coded
in morkWriter.cpp[2], so the character encoding it gives can never be
anything other than iso-8859-1. This may simply be a hint to human
readers.

Mork files can indicate end-of-line using several conventions. According
to the documentation[1], any of the combinations 0x0A, 0x0D, 0x0A0D, and
0x0D0A are allowed. This covers the three common conventions (Unix,
DOS/Windows, and Macintosh) and the uncommon 'newline carriage-return'.

2.2 Syntax Elements

Here is a short example Mork file for reference (Example 1):

// <!-- <mdb:mork:z v="1.4"/> -->
< <(a=c)> // (f=iso-8859-1)
  (80=Category)(81=FilmTitle)(82=Winner)(83=Other)(84=ns:awards)>

<(80=Best Picture)(81=Annie Hall)(82=Best Director)(83=Woody Allen)(84
  =Best Actor in a Leading Role)(85=Richard Dreyfuss)(86=The Goodbye Girl)
  (87=Best Actress in a Leading Role)(88=Diane Keaton)>
{1:^84
  [1 (^80^80)(^81^81)(^82^81)(^83=)]
  [2 (^80^82)(^81^81)(^82^83)(^83=)]
  [3 (^80^84)(^81^86)(^82^85)(^83=)]
  [4 (^80^87)(^81^81)(^82^88)(^83=)]}

Expanded to table form, it looks like this:

Row | Category                       | Winner           | FilmTitle        | Other
----|--------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------
  1 | Best Picture                   | Annie Hall       | Annie Hall       |
  2 | Best Director                  | Woody Allen      | Annie Hall       |
  3 | Best Actor in a Leading Role   | Richard Dreyfuss | The Goodbye Girl |
  4 | Best Actress in a Leading Role | Diane Keaton     | Annie Hall       |

2.2.1 Comments and Magic

Mork files can include comments using C++ comment syntax. Two forward
slashes indicate the beginning of a comment which continues to the end
of the line. While this seems to be undocumented, the source code
(morkParser.cpp[2]) indicates that C-style comments are also permitted,
and may be nested. These appear to be unused in practice.

There are some places where comments are not recognized. The only
example I know of (and the only one that's likely to be relevant in real
Mork files) is in Cell and Alias values.

Mork files begin with the following "magic" identifier in the form of a
comment:

// <!-- <mdb:mork:z v="1.4"/> -->

The 1.4 would of course be different for other Mork versions.

2.2.2 Dictionaries

Mork Dictionaries or "Dicts" are used to define numerical aliases for
strings (meaning Columns and Values). This is simply a file size
optimization and does not add anything functional. It does however add
substantial complexity to the files.

Dicts are delimited with "angle brackets" (less-than and greater-than
symbols) and contain Aliases, and optionally a Meta-Dict.

Example:

<(80=arbitrary text)(81=http://example.com)
(8C=(Parens are allowed, but a closing paren needs to be escaped.\))>

In this example, note that the '//' does not introduce a comment, and a
backslash character is used as an escape character to allow a closing
parenthesis to appear in the Value.

Each Dict defines aliases for a particular namespace or scope. In
principle there can be an arbitrary number of scopes, but in practice
only two are used: 'a' and 'c', which are abbreviations for 'atom' and
'column', respectively. The 'a' scope defines aliases used in Cell
values, and the 'c' scope defines aliases used in Cell columns. The
scope for a Dict is given in the Meta-Dict, or else defaults to 'a'.

Typical Mork files have only one Dict for the 'c' scope (the first thing
in the file following the magic line), and several for the 'a' scope.
Each Dict encountered in the file just updates the in-memory Dict with
new aliases.

In Example 1, there are two Dicts:

< <(a=c)>
  (80=Category)(81=FilmTitle)(82=Winner)(83=Other)(84=ns:awards)>

<(80=Best Picture)(81=Annie Hall)(82=Best Director)(83=Woody Allen)(84
  =Best Actor in a Leading Role)(85=Richard Dreyfuss)(86=The Goodbye Girl)
  (87=Best Actress in a Leading Role)(88=Diane Keaton)>

The first Dict is for the 'c' scope and the second is for the 'a' scope.

2.2.3 Aliases

Aliases and Cells are very similar, but Aliases are specific to Dicts.
Aliases have this form:

(A3=Arbitrary text)

The left side of the '=' sign is a hexadecimal integer, and the right
side can be any text (though some characters have to be represented with
escape sequences). This makes the hexadecimal value an alias for the
text on the right.

In the file morkParser.cpp[2], function ReadAlias, there's another type
or Alias that seems to be unused in practice, and probably not fully
supported by the code. It looks something like:

(A3<f=c>=Arbitrary text) or (A3<f=^BF>=Arbitrary text)

This is probably intended to specify an alternate character encoding for
the Alias value, but again, it appears to be unused and not fully
supported.

2.2.4 Cells

Cells function as key-value pairs. They form the basis of Mork Rows,
where the key represents a column name and the value represents the data
in that column of the row. They also define the meta-data in
Meta-Tables, Meta-Rows, and Meta-Dicts.

Like Aliases, Cells are delimited by parentheses. The most basic form of
a Cell looks pretty much like an Alias:

(keyName=arbitrary value text)

Here the key is 'keyName' and the value is 'arbitrary value text'. It's
also possible for the value to be empty:

(keyName=)

Both the key and the value can optionally be replaced with an alias
previously defined in a Dict. When the key is replaced, it looks like
this:

(^92=arbitrary value text)

When the value is replaced, the '=' sign is dropped:

(keyName^A5)

It's common to see a lot of cells with both the key and value replaced
by aliases:

(^92^A5)

When an alias is used for the key, it is looked up in the 'c' scope
(this was described in the 'Dictionaries' section). For the value, it is
looked up in the 'a' scope.

It's also possible for alias scopes to be given explicitly, which looks
like this:

(^92:c^A5:a)
(^92:c^A5)
(^92^A5:a)

These are all equivalent to the previous example because the scopes used
are the same as the default scopes.

Confusingly, scopes can also be replaced with aliases:

(^92:^E8^A5)

A scope alias is looked up in the 'c' scope.

2.2.5 Rows

Rows are the typical container for Cells. In the Mork file syntax they
are delimited with square brackets. Here's a row from Example 1:

  [2 (^80^82)(^81^81)(^82^83)(^83=)]

Here the 2 is the hexadecimal identifier for the row, which contains
four Cells (which represent the data in four columns of the row).

Mork files will often contain multiple rows with the same identifier.
Duplicate rows generally appear inside Groups (though the code seems to
support duplicates anywhere rows can appear). This has the effect of
updating the in-memory Row with new or replacement items. Row updates
are described in more detail in the section on Groups.

Rows will often appear inside Tables, but not always. A Row outside of
any Table could be inserted into a Table later, or it could be an update
for a Row that is already in a Table. In some cases rows are created but
never used in any table. Presumably these rows can be ignored.

The Row identifier belongs to a particular namespace or scope. This is
pretty much like the scopes that Dict aliases occupy, but row namespaces
tend to be more descriptive. Here's an example:

< <(a=c)> (80=ns:addrbk:db:row:scope:data:all)>
[4:^80(^23^A8)(^24^28)]

When a Row identifier lacks an explicit scope, it inherits the scope
from the table that it's contained in.
