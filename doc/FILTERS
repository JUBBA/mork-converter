Filters have been re-designed from the first versions of this
application. They still serve two basic purposes (manipulating the
database and doing output of the data), but the distinction is less
explicit.

All filters are now located in src/MorkDB/filters.

The file tutorial.py is a tutorial for writing a filter that performs
output. Read it in a text editor. The xml_output.py filter also has a
lot of comments and serves as a decent tutorial itself.

Filters now have an explicit ordering. Each filter declares its order
with the mork_filter_order attribute. This is just an integer which must
be non-negative for active filters and determines the order in which
filters are applied. The file src/MorkDB/filters/filterbase.py describes
the basic meaning of certain values, providing guidelines for which
value ranges to use for certain purposes.
