There are two types of filters:

Output filters are used to write output. This determines the output
format and location. These filters can be found in
src/MorkDB/filter/output.

Database filters do translation and tweaking of databases prior to
output. These filters can be found in src/MorkDB/filter/database.

The file tutorial.py is a tutorial for writing an output filter. Read it
in a text editor. The xml.py output filter also has a lot of comments
and serves as a decent tutorial itself.

Database filters don't have any explicit documentation, but they are
very similar to output filters. The only differences are in the names of
the required elements -- instead of a _MORK_OUTPUT_FILTER variable to
identify the filter, database filters have a _MORK_DATABASE_FILTER
variable. Instead of a function called output(), database filters have a
function called filter(). I know, I shouldn't have used the name of an
existing built-in function for this.
