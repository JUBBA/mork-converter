Version 2.1

* To make conversion faster, the parse tree for each Mork file is now
  saved in a file with the same name as the input file, but with
  .parse-tree appended. On subsequent conversion runs, the parse tree
  will be read directly instead of re-parsing the Mork file. These
  .parse-tree files can be safely deleted.
* A new filter for doing field conversions has been added. This filter
  is enabled by default and its purpose is to make the output more
  readable. It converts times to a common format (similar to but more
  functional than the 'times' filter, which has been removed), converts
  hexadecimal values to decimal, and expands numeric values to symbolic
  names.
* Some restructuring of the encoding filter has been done, which makes
  it only attempt to guess the byte order at the point where the byte
  order is actually needed. This may make it a bit faster, but more
  importantly it may prevent some spurious warnings about the byte order
  being guessed.
* No longer exits with a traceback on Ctrl-C or a broken pipe.

Version 2.0

* Completely new command line interface. This makes it much more
  standard.
* Completely new filter architecture. This makes filters simpler and
  ties them into the command line parser, allowing the nicer command
  line interface.
* New mime_headers filter to decode RFC 2047 MIME-encoded email headers.
* XML output is more strictly conforming, with warnings for some
  unhandled cases.
* Works harder to identify the character encoding used for each field.
* Allows character encodings to be supplied on the command line, both
  for the output file and for the interpretation of input database
  fields.
* The date/time filter now recognizes one additional type of time field
  that was missing before.
* Switching to GPL2 for the license.

Version 1.1

* Fixed bug: Tables containing -<objectId> caused a SyntaxError. The
  parser didn't know this form of row-removal was allowed (because the
  parser author didn't know).
* Fixed bug: '!' character causes LexingError. Lexer and parser now
  recognize '!' as the row-move operator.
* Table rows are now kept in order rather than the order of the rows
  being arbitrary. This allows the row-move operator ('!') to make
  sense.
* Added mork-documentation.txt with references to existing sources of
  documentation.
* Added mork-format.txt, my far-from-complete attempt to fully document
  the format.
* Modified group (AKA transaction) abort syntax to recognize the form
  that appears to be used in practice. The old form (what appears in the
  documentation) is still recognized as well.
* Minor updates for PLY version 3.
* Much smarter lexer. Mork is nearly "unlexable", so a lot of lexer
  states are used. Mozilla's implementation cheats by using the parser
  state to determine what lexical tokens to look for.
* Added emptycells filter that removes cells with empty values. This is
  especially useful with address books convented to XML, where you
  normally get a lot of empty elements.

Version 1.0.1

* Restored demork.py to its original form. This is one of the example
  programs, not actually part of mork-converter.

Version 1.0

* Initial release
