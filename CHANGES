Version 1.1

* Fixed bug: Tables containing -<objectId> caused a SyntaxError. The
  parser didn't know this form of row-removal was allowed (because the
  parser author didn't know).
* Fixed bug: '!' character causes LexingError. Lexer and parser now
  recognize '!' as the row-move operator.
* Table rows are now kept in order rather than the order of the rows
  being arbitrary. This allows the row-move operator ('!') to make
  sense.
* Added mork-documentation.txt with references to existing sources of
  documentation.
* Added mork-format.txt, my far-from-complete attempt to fully document
  the format.
* Modified group (AKA transaction) abort syntax to recognize the form
  that appears to be used in practice. The old form (what appears in the
  documentation) is still recognized as well.
* Minor updates for PLY version 3.
* Much smarter lexer. Mork is nearly "unlexable", so a lot of lexer
  states are used. Mozilla's implementation cheats by using the parser
  state to determine what lexical tokens to look for.
* Added emptycells filter that removes cells with empty values. This is
  especially useful with address books convented to XML, where you
  normally get a lot of empty elements.

Version 1.0.1

* Restored demork.py to its original form. This is one of the example
  programs, not actually part of mork-converter.

Version 1.0

* Initial release
