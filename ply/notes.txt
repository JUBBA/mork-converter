* morkParser.cpp is a good reference.
* Look into cleaning up parsing tables, rows, and cells with '-'.
* Might want a custom warning class for unimplemented mork features.
* Missing a lot of exception handling.

Groups and updates
* My best guess is that a - before the ID means "remove all items, then
  process what follows." This assumes that the ID may or may not exist
  (i.e., the - is basically a no-op for a non-existing item).
