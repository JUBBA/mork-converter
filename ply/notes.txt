* morkParser.cpp is a good reference.
* Look into cleaning up parsing tables, rows, and cells with '-'.
* Might want a custom warning class for unimplemented mork features.
* Missing a lot of exception handling.
* Maybe add meta-table suppression option.
* Maybe add row ID as a hidden column, optionally displayed.
* Add XML output.
