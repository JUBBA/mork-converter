* Meta tables can apparently have rows, both literal and referenced by id.
  * Maybe make 'row' non-terminal a literal row or id.
* There are several places where a '-' can indicate removing things:
  * [-...] to remove all columns from the row
  * {-...} to remove all rows from the table
  * -(...) to remove a cell
  * -[...] to remove a row
* morkParser.cpp is a good reference.
